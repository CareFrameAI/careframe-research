## LLM Important Notice

**IMPORTANT**: CareFrame is designed as a healthcare and research platform that may process sensitive data. Please note the following:

- CareFrame v0.1 is EXPERIMENTAL and by default uses cloud-based LLM providers (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) when API keys are configured.
- Using cloud-based LLMs means your data may be transmitted to third-party services.
- For production use or when handling sensitive/PHI data, you MUST:
  1. Use only local LLM models
  2. Remove all external API keys
  3. Configure appropriate security measures
  4. Follow all applicable data privacy regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

The developers of CareFrame take NO RESPONSIBILITY for any data breaches, privacy violations, or other security issues that may arise from using cloud-based LLMs with sensitive data.
